## About AIVA

The program starts by greeting the user and asking for their name. It then gives the option to input queries via voice or text. If voice input is chosen, it listens for the query; otherwise, it prompts for text input. The program searches for HTML tags in the database based on the query. If found, it displays tag details; otherwise, it searches Wikipedia for information. It then asks if the user wants to search again, ending when the user declines or exits.

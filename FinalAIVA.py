'''
This code is the main function of the voice assistant program.
It starts by greeting the user and asking for their name.
Then, it asks the user if they would like to input their query through voice or text.
If the user chooses 'voice', the program listens for their query and stores it in a variable.
If the user chooses 'text', the program prompts the user to type their query and stores it in a variable.
The query is then passed to the search_html_tag function to search for any HTML tags.
If a result is found, it will be returned and displayed.
